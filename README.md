Game for Lame Jam 54 made with Raylib, Emscripten and NoBuild.

can be build for linux or for web, for linux run ./example_build.sh
for web you will need:
- python
- Emscripten (it will setup everything else)
- Raylib compiled with Emscripten
- zip (my nob autopackages web build, you can remove it in nob.c)
